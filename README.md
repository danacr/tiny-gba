# Gopher Zuri

![Gopher GBA game](doc/gopher-gba.png)

Heavily based on [Learning Go by examples by Aur√©lie Vache](https://dev.to/aurelievache/learning-go-by-examples-part-5-create-a-game-boy-advance-gba-game-in-go-5944) article series on Dev.to.

For Tinygo package compatibility: https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/lang-support/stdlib/#time

## General

This simple app/game run on Game Boy Advance portable console and:
* display a screen with "Gopher" text and "Press START button"
* display two gophers
* When you press START button: your Gopher player just appear
* With multi directionnal arrows you can move your Gopher at left, right, top or bottom
* When you press A button: your Gopher jump :-D 
* When you press SELECT button, you go back to "Start" screen

## Pre-requisites

Install Go in 1.16 version minimum.

Brew:
```bash
brew install go-task
brew install tinygo
brew install mgba
```

## Run the app (during development)

```
task run
```

Note: `time` does not work: https://remyhax.xyz/posts/gba-blog/ https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/issues/1578

## Build the app

`task build`

## Test the app/game

Let's run our app on mGBA emulator:

`task mgba`


### mGBA Controls

Controls are configurable in the **settings** menu of **mGBA**. Many game controllers should be automatically mapped by default. 
The default keyboard controls are as follows:

```
A: X
B: Z
L: A
R: S
Start: Enter
Select: Backspace
```

### My changes:

- I've refactored some of the functions
- Improved the speed of the Gopher movement by implementing the [redrawing the gopher](https://dev.to/aurelievache/learning-go-by-examples-part-5-create-a-game-boy-advance-gba-game-in-go-5944#comment-1i83i)
- Added a check if the gopher is within the display frame
- Added a Game Kill Screen :)
